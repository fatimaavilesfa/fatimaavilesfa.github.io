## I'm Fatima

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Fatima Aviles, a Javascript enthusiast making apps in Mexico. I also program
in Lisp, C, and TypeScript, but if you're reading this you're probably more interested in my Javascript skills.

In addition to my professional web dev work, I'm also active in competitive coding and code puzzles. Here is my profile
on the code puzzle site CodeWars:

Talk to me! I love what I do, and I like talking about it :)
